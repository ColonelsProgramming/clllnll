         I'm a graphic and web designer. Like as it is said above,
         a good design is a good business. 
         You should invest in your design and value it highly, 
         because it plays such an important role 
         in marketing and advertising.
         It adds vividness to your website,logo etc. 
         That catches the viewers attention and increases the viewers interest 
         in your prdouct/service. As I mentioned, im a designer
         and I put alot of work and enthusiasm in my designs.
         I want all my clients to have a product 
         that's worth their money and I want them to enjoy it.
         That is why I give all my customers the chance to give me 
         a improvement order, so I can revise my work to their likes.
